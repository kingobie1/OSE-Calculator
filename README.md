# Calculator

This is a small side project I started on May 6, 2016. It’s a calculator made with Java. I used Java Swing and Window Builder for the UI design.

In order to run the file, open it up in Eclipse and run `Main.java` as a Java Application or download and run the [runnable jar](http://obase.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/0/4/56044521/ose_calculator.jar) or [mac app](http://obase.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/0/4/56044521/ose_calculator.app.zip) provided in the given links.

To change the color theme of the app type, ⌘+T.
