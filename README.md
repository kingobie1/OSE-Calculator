# Calculator

This is a small side project I started on May 6, 2016. It’s a calculator made in Java using Swing and Window Builder for the UI. 

In order to run the file, open in up in Eclipse and run `Main.java` as a Java Application or open up the [runnable jar](http://obase.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/0/4/56044521/ose_calculator.jar) from the provided link.

## Controls
